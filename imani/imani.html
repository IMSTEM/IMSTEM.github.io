                    <p>Today, I'm excited to delve into the topic of gynecology. 
                    My birthday is the 19th of May, and I am a rising senior at the City of Medicine Academy. 
                    Furthering my academic pursuits, I'm also dual-enrolled at Durham Technical Community 
                    College where I am taking college-level courses such as Psychology and English 111. </p>

                    <p>My goal post-high school is to specialize in the field of gynecology and work towards becoming an 
                    Obstetrician-Gynecologist (OBGYN). As I look towards the future, I'm considering several colleges 
                    for my undergraduate studies.</p> 
                
                    <p>My top choices currently are North Carolina Central University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
                    and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>
                 
                   
                   <p>
                     Today I will be going over Gynecology. What is Gynecology? The branch of physiology and medicine which deals with the functions and diseases specific to women and girls, especially those affecting the reproductive system.
