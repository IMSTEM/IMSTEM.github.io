                      <p> Where oh where could she be? Ezra's favorite side hobby is photography and story telling. She began photography classes during her 2nd year at Duke under Susie Post-Rust. This upcoming fall, she will be an assistant teacher for a Documentary Studies photography course taught by Post-Rust. Her past works include stories about Black Cowboys in the USA, the history of Durham School of the Arts, Black Joy, and much more! </p>
                    
                      <p> Ezra loves to keep busy on campus. She is a goaltender for Duke Women's Club Lacrosse and Men's Ice Hockey. Outside of practice, Ezra also serves as the Coeditor in Chief for KHAYA Magazine, a Black magazine for students on Duke's campus. </p>

                    <p>Khaya Magazine was founded in Spring 2020 and is the first African magazine on campus. For me and so many other Black students on Duke’s campus, Khaya is more than a magazine production. Khaya has been a home away from home, a place where we feel loved, accepted, and celebrated. With my photos, I wanted to show the pure magic in Black joy. I want to give a big thanks to the executive staff at Khaya: Azana Green, Lydia Sellers, Sydney Reed, Tiana Horace, Urena Okoye, and James Mbuthia.</p>

                    <p>Formerly Durham High, the Durham School of the Arts reached its centennial this year. Having been around for 100 years, DSA is just as full of history as it is creative students. For the past 11 years, DSA has hosted a Fall Arts Festival on Dia de Los Muertos. The festival was started by Amber Caroll SantibanÌƒez, a DSA alumna who now teaches on the visual arts track. The festival is a space for students to explore their own history, express themselves, and celebrate life and change. This year, Santibañez wanted to incorporate the history of the school and the memories within the walls.
                  
                  While working on this project, DSA felt like home. I want to say thank you to Mrs. Santibañez for allowing me into your classroom and sharing your stories and life with me. Thank you for reminding me what it means to be a teacher and for reminding me just as you do with your students to tell our stories</p>
