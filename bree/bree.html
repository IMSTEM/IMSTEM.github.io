                        Since 2006, Inspiring Minds (IM) has provided thousands of under-represented youth in the Mahoning Valley with the opportunities and motivation to overcome the 
                        obstacles that stand between them and personal success. Our mission is to engage, inspire and empower youth through education and exposure to new 
                        experiences within a safe, positive environment; one that strengthens confidence and character. 
                        
                        <p>Our vision is to see every student graduate high school, complete college or a vocational school and become strong, successful members of our society.
                        And our goal is to inspire youth to discover their passions and equip them with the tools needed to pursue them. </p>
                        
                        <p>IM After-School and Summer Enrichment Programming focuses on 5 areas of impact: Education, College & Career Readiness, Exposure, Health & Wellness and Personal Development.</p>
                        
                       <p> The IM After-School Component helps to improve classroom performance and increase student readiness for college and vocations by taking advantage of what might otherwise be 
                        unsupervised time, weekdays between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Our 6-week Summer Enrichment Component offers a combination of academics, athletics, nutrition, 
                        cultural and other fun activities focused on decreasing summer learning loss, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. </p>
