                    <p>I am 17 years old and I value doing acts of kindness. I am aware that many young people struggle with mental health issues. 
                        I want EVERYONE who struggles with their mental and emotional health to be able to gain something from this website (although with a concentration on young people). 
                        On this page, a number of types of challenges that our youth cope with and find difficult to process are listed. On this page, you'll find inspiration and solutions. 
                        The major message is to make people aware that everyone is struggling with something. 
                        Unfortunately, that is the way life is. You'll persevere though, because nothing in life is permanent. You can do this.</p>

                        <h2>Self&nbsp;Esteem&nbsp; </h2>
                        <p>How would you reply if someone asked you if you had a high sense of self-worth? Do you let other people's perceptions of you influence how you feel about yourself? 
                            Do your interactions with others impact how you feel about yourself internally? It's okay if you don't know the answers to these questions or if you answer "no" to any of them because self-esteem is all about how you feel about yourself. 
                            Your self-esteem can be raised by discovering who you are, what you enjoy and dislike, and accepting yourself completely. </p> 
                        <p> Spending time alone is the first piece of advice. It's been stated a lot, but it's still vital. Consider how you build relationships 
                            with your loved ones by spending time with them. Use the same approach to build relationships with yourself by doing things you enjoy, 
                            watching motivational videos, reading self-love books, and writing positive affirmations that you may post on your door or mirror. 
                            Look for something that makes you appreciate yourself.</p>

                        <h2>Anxiety&nbsp; </h2>
                        <p>I personally struggle a lot with anxiety. I frequently get anxiety, and I worry and overthink a lot. 
                            These emotions are difficult to deal with and can occasionally feel very overwhelming. Understanding what anxiety is, for me, is helpful.  
                            Anxiety is characterized by intense, excessive, and ongoing nervousness and dread about ordinary events. 
                            There may be symptoms such as a fast breathing pattern, sweating, and fatigue. Of course, each person will experience their 
                            own unique symptoms, 
                            but these are just a few. 
                            Having anxiety is common; we all experience occasional uncertainty and worry. But if you're anything like me, 
                            you could have to deal with it constantly, and it interferes with your regular tasks. Accepting that you are a human 
                            being who struggles with things is the first step in solving that problem. It's acceptable to acknowledge any type of 
                            suffering, even anxiety. Don't ever be afraid to walk comfortably in your defects since they are what make you who you are as a person. 
                            Everyone has flaws and imperfections. Connecting with someone is the second step. There are many people that experience axnitey; it is very typical.  
                            Being vulnerable and open with others can be quite advantageous. You feel better knowing you're not alone and can observe how they handle theirs. 
                            Keep in mind that even your darkest days are part of your progress. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance from dependable people or even a therapist. 
                            There are so many young organizations that will support and listen to you; you can do this..</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="box effect1">  
                        <h2>Body&nbsp; Image&nbsp; </h2>
                        <p>It's absurd how many standards and expectations there are for beauty in society. Since it is unattractive and no man would want them, women shouldn't cover up or dress loosely. 
                            They cannot dress tightly since it draws attention to their figure and makes them appear hoe-like. Men who are too short are unattractive and undateable, but if they are really 
                            wealthy, it is acceptable. Men aren't supposed to display emotions because it makes them appear weak, but when they do, they often face criticism for their poor 
                            communication skills. While that has having nothing to do with physical appearance, this just serves to highlight how unrealistic and hypocritical society is. 
                            Our generation now oversexualizes both men and women's bodies. Because sex sells, you may see it in music videos. It's normal to have preferences or merely find 
                            someone attractive—it's part of being human. When people insult anyone who doesn't meet their standards of beauty, it's a problem.  Remember that you are under 
                            no obligation to fit into anyone's mold. Your body is a temple that you use for reaching your goals, not for unimportant others to judge you on. Although you have 
                            no control over what other people say or do, you do have power over how you react.  Being realistic, people expect us to wake up every morning and be a perfect piece 
                            of cake despite the fact that our bodies develop hair, gain weight, lose weight, have scars, acne, hyperpimintation, pimples, us women have monthly periods, etc. 
                            Keep in mind that something will always be said about you, so you must always act as though you care nothing since you are great just the way you are. However, if 
                            there is something about yourself that you would like to change, go ahead and do it for yourself rather than for other people, as their opinions of you may change over 
                            time from one day to the next. 
                            you are gonna be with yourself for the rest of your life so change for you and nobody else.</p>

                        <h2>Self&nbsp; Harm&nbsp; /&nbsp; Suicide&nbsp;</h2>
                        <p>According too https://www.uclahealth.org/ "Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people age 15 to 24 in the U.S. Nearly 20% of high school students report serious 
                            thoughts of suicide and 9%" In our generation, and particularly among us teenagers, we constantly hear or even express that we want to 
                            "kill ourselves." Although it's a figure of speech we use to convey how stressed or overwhelmed we are with life, this may not be meant to be taken literally. It just goes to 
                            demonstrate how poor our generation's mental health is because it's so prevalent.  There is a lot of criticism about suicide as well. Of course, this isn't anything to celebrate, 
                            but let's normalize the idea of people experiencing such feelings and dealing with life without taking any further action. We all experience terrible points in our lives when it
                             seems as though everything is falling apart, but I assure you, that you will survive. Don't let a temporary issue have a permanent answer; 
                            instead, seek out the things that make you happy and recall the times you felt joy and excitement.</p>

                        <h2>Negataive&nbsp; Impacts&nbsp; Of&nbsp; Social&nbsp; Media&nbsp; </h2>
                        <p>We all use or have used social media, and we are aware that it can have both positive and negative aspects. 
                            The fact that you are in control of your own behavior makes it important to be mindful of how you are using the app, but 
                            that doesn't change the possibility that how other people use it will have an impact on our youth's health.On social networking 
                            apps, there have been so many horrific things that have happened. For instance, a little girl accidentally shot her relative on Instagram Live before shooting herself afterwards. 
                            Of course, the young woman's goal in using the weapon for play was not to kill anyone, so the real question is why she was even showing off her gunplay in the first place. Was what 
                            she had seen other people do online what influenced her? People post things on social media under the pretense that they are hip and enjoyable, but they aren't. Not to mention all 
                            the online bullying that takes place on the application. I realize the phrase "bullying" is overused and not taken seriously, but what people say behind their screens is absurd. 
                            The majority of the time, those who make harsh comments and remarks are unhappy with their own life and have nothing better to do. Additionally, many times those leaving comments
                             don't even know the person they are referring to. They'll be advising you to "kill yourself" and "The world is better off without you," but for what purpose? What do you gain by 
                             telling someone that? How can you harbor such resentment toward those who don't even care about you? At the end of the day, we need to keep in mind that social media is meant to 
                             be used for fun rather than to tear others down.
                             Block and delete anyone who is making your experience on the platform unpleasant for you; you aren't required to associate, follow, or be friends with everyone, especially if they 
                             aren't being kind. And if that's still not enough, remove the app and remind yourself that you are the only one who has power over your life, so why take it so seriously in the case
                              of something like that? Your value and worth are determined by you alone; this is why it is referred to as your own worth. </p>
