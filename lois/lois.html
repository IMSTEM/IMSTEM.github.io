                    <h1>Hello world My name is Lois Jackson!</h1> 
                    <p>I am 17 years old and I value doing acts of kindness. I am aware that many young people struggle with mental health issues. I want EVERYONE who struggles with their mental and emotional health to be able to gain something from this website (although with a concentration on young people). On this page, a number of types of challenges that our youth cope with and find difficult to process are listed. On this page, you'll find inspiration and solutions. The major message is to make people aware that everyone is struggling with something. Unfortunately, that is the way life is. You'll persevere though, because nothing in life is permanent. You can do this.</p>
                  
                    <div>  Self esteem- How would you reply if someone asked you if you had a high sense of self-worth? Do you let other people's perceptions of you influence how you feel about yourself? Do your interactions with others impact how you feel about yourself internally? It's okay if you don't know the answers to these questions or if you answer "no" to any of them because self-esteem is all about how you feel about yourself. Your self-esteem can be raised by discovering who you are, what you enjoy and dislike, and accepting yourself completely. 
                   Spending time alone is the first piece of advice. It's been stated a lot, but it's still vital. Consider how you build relationships with your loved ones by spending time with them. Use the same approach to build relationships with yourself by doing things you enjoy, watching motivational videos, reading self-love books, and writing positive affirmations that you may post on your door or mirror. Look for something that makes you appreciate yourself.
